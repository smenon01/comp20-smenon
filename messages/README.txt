The lab parses data from a JSON file using the XMLHttpRequest object, and output the data to a section of the html page.

Approximate time spent: 1 hour

The data does not load when using data from a local machine or with the given URI. You cannot request data from a different origin or your local machine using XMLHttpRequest because of security reasons. Opening up a file locally could potentially lead to uploading malicious or dangerous documents/scripts into your browser. Additionally, exchanging or interacting with data from a different origin also can lead to security risks, and opens up browsers to attacks from cross-site scripting. With the same-origin policy, only pages with the same origin can read and modify each otherâ€™s content, to prevent potentially dangerous websites from having access to sensitive data, controls, or resources on another page. Interactions from websites with different origins can occur if Cross-Origin Request Sharing (CORS) is allowed from the server you are requesting from.
