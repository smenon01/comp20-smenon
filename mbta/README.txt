This lab is a continuation from last week’s mbta lab: this time, the user’s geolocation is determined, and indicated by a marker on the map (different from the markers for the subway stations). A polyline is drawn from the user’s marker/location to the closest subway station and when pressing the user marker, the info window displays which station is closest and the distance away is miles (this distance is calculated using the Haversine formula, and the JS code used in this lab is from: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14560999/using-the-haversine-formula-in- javascript). Also, when each subway station is clicked on, the info window displays the upcoming trains at that station. 

Approximate time spent: 4-5 hours
