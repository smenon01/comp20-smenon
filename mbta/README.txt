This lab is part 3 of the mbta lab. The map should now connect to the server created via heroku which serves the JSON real-time data feed of the mbta red line trains. The cross-origin sharing should be enabled on GET /redline.json. The GET request worked locally and when deployed on heroku. This application also attempts to record the latitude/longitude of users accessing the map using HTTP POST—I was able to accomplish this when testing locally, but when I deployed, I was not able to get the location data into the database—in the POST, the db.insert failed and gave the following error: “TypeError: Cannot read property 'collection' of null”, which I was not able to figure out how to solve.

Approximate time spent: 8 hours
