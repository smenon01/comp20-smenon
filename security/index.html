			<h1>Security Assessment of Vulnerable App</h1>
			
			<p>Surya Menon &bull; 8/14/2016 &bull; COMP20 </p>
			
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>This page has the security assessment of a potentially vulnerable 
			web application, developed as part of the Comp20 Week 6 Assignment. This application 
			allows users to "check-in" (similar Foursquare, but titled "Not Foursquare"), by
			providing their username and location (longitude and latitude coordinates). All
			users checked-in are displayed on the root page. Users can additionally search
			for a particular username's check-in(s). The objective of this assessment
			was to look for potential security and privacy issues in this application,
			as well as possible solutions.</p>
			
			<h2>Methodology</h2>
			<p>Testing for vulnerabilities was done through a combination of black-box
			testing (without reading the source code) as well as looking into the source code itself
			for potential issues, and subsequently conducting white-box testing. The code was run 
			and tested locally on my own computer, using the <code>curl</code> tool when making POST
			requests. Additionally, when running locally, I connected to a local mongo instance.</p>
			
			<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
			<p>The security issues found in this application are predominantly 
			related to putting too much trust into user input, without proper 
			validation and escaping. This unchecked input can enable a potential attacker
			to: submit code that could be sent back to and subsequently affect other users, or
			conduct searches on the database connected to the application that reveal more
			information than they should. Additionally, a privacy issue was found in how 
			data submitted by other users to the database becomes easily accessible.</p>
			
			<h2>Issues Found</h2>
			<ol>
			<li><span class = "stronger">Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</span>
			<ul>
			<li> Found when making GET request</li>
			<li> Severity - <span class = "bolden">High</span>: This is a pretty significant security risk, in particular
			to other client/sites accessing the application, that can be impacted by 
			potentially harmful user inputs. </li>
			<li> This issue was discovered when submitting data via POST request, for example:
			<code>curl --data "login=Socrates &lt;script&gtalert('All we are is dust in the wind');&lt/script&gt&lat=0&lng=0" http://localhost:3000/sendLocation</code>. 
			While the data for locations (longitude and latitude) are validated before being 
			put in the database, the login query data is not sanitized or validated, and 
			therefore JavaScript can be put in its place. When running a subsequent GET request, 
			this code is echoed and executed on a client browser. In the example above, an 
			<code>alert</code> window is loaded before we are then able to see the list of check-ins, with the 
			newest at the top (pictured below). Another example of data submitted into
			the login could be: <code>login=Squirtle&lt;script&gtwindow.location.href = 'https://
			www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v74oV4qXRI';&lt/script&gt</code>, which would end up reloading
			the page to a different website; this could be particularly dangerous if
			a client using this application is suddenly rerouted to a malicious website.</li>
			<img class = "center" src = "alert_after.png" alt = "After Alert Example" />
			<li> Resolution: Escape potentially problematic characters in the user input 
			before putting into the database (i.e. <code>&lt, &gt, &amp</code>) using
			<code>escape(login)</code>. Additionally, OWASP recommends to also conduct input validation, 
			such as using a whitelist to determine if the input is only using 
			specified characters (<code>validator.isWhitelisted()</code>), and if the input
			is the correct length and format (<code>validator.isLength()</code> and 
			<code>validator.matches()</code> methods). Furthermore, escaping 
			updates can be conducted in the database to previous submissions.</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li><span class = "stronger">MongoDB injection</span> 
			<ul>
			<li> Found when making a GET via <code>/checkins.json</code> route</li>
			<li> Severity - <span class = "bolden">Moderate</span>: The attacker cannot perform any query on the database,
			however, can perform queries that make data easily available to anyone
			through simple modifications.</li>
			<li> This issue was discovered when looking at code for the making user search
			for specific user check-ins, which uses a GET request. The Mongo database conducts 
			the search through the collection with the login parameter, but this input is 
			not escaped or fully validated. Therefore, entering a query such 
			as <code>login[$ne]=" "</code> results in bringing back all of the data in the 
			database, instead of the specific check-in result. This is problematic in that 
			an attacker can have access to all of the entries in the database, and if there 
			is other sensitive data stored in other fields in the documents, these will 
			also be exposed.</li> 
			<img class="center" src = "Injection.png" alt = "Injection Example" /> 
			<li> Resolution: Similar to above, validate input as a particular type and format or as 
			only accepting particular values (such as alphanumeric only, <code>validator.isAlphanumeric()</code>),
			and sanitize by escaping common HTML characters and removing other special 
			characters (i.e. <code>$</code>) with a whitelist of characters.</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li><span class = "stronger">Returning all inputs in database to user after POST</span>
			<ul>
			<li> Found when making a POST via <code>/sendLocation</code> route</li>
			<li> Severity - <span class = "bolden">Moderate</span>: Using a POST request and being returned data from the 
			database is problematic, because it makes potentially sensitive data easily available,
			similar to the issue above. A database collection's entire contents should not be so easily 
			shared from a simple data submission.</li>
			<li> This issue was discovered when using the <code>curl</code> tool to make
			a POST request to the web application, specifically: <code>curl --data "login=Sirius Black&lat=-55&lng=99" http://localhost:3000/sendLocation</code>.
			After this request is sent, all of the documents in the database collection are returned
			for the user making the submission to see. This practice is a significant privacy issue 
			because documents could have other fields with potentially sensitive data stored in them. 
			If a user makes a POST request, they should not then be able to see everything in 
			the collection. Similar to the injection issue above, this vulnerability could make 
			data too accessible to attackers. While this particular web application is not
			necessarily storing any sensitive information, if modified in the future to do so, this
			could pose a significant problem.</li> 
			<img class="center" src = "post_request_return.png" alt = "POST request return" /> 
			<li> Resolution: Instead of traversing through the collection and returning each
			document, only the user's submitted data stored in the variable <code>toInsert</code> should
			be sent back in the response: <code>response.send(toInsert);</code>.
			</ul></li>
			</ol>
			
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p> The solutions provided should help reduce the web application's vulnerability
			to potentially harmful user input, as well as limit any one user's access
			to data submitted to the application's database. Furthermore, perhaps
			implementing some type of verification of the user when entering data into
			the application could also reduce untrusted input submission.</p>
